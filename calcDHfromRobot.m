function [symDH] = calcDHfromRobot(numJoints, jointTypes, linkLengths, zAxis, linkDir)
%UNTITLED12 Calculate DH parameters from Robot parameters
%   Takes input from the base frame to the end effector from. The base
%   frame is taken as co-incidental with the frame of the first joint.
%   Inputs: 
%         : Zaxis - The Z Axis of the joints. For revolute joints it is the
%                   axis of rotation, For prismatic joints it is the axis
%                   of translations. Runs from first joint to the end
%                   effector (inclusive)
%         : jointTypes - The types of joints, From the first joint to the
%                        end effector (inclusive)
%         : linkLengths - The length of the links between the joints, Only
%                         number of links
%         : numJoints - The number of joints in the system, runs from the
%                       first joint to the end effector (inclusive)
%         : linkDir - The direction of the links between the joints. From
%                     first joint to the end effector (inclusive). Only the
%                     number of links
%
%   Outputs:
%          : Outputs a DH table with symbols in the place of the variables

%Maybe we need to ask for the link direction as well? This will help
%fetermine o_i and o_i prime so that a and d can be determined more easily.
%If we know the link Direction, o_i is the current zAxis coordinate, and
%o_i prime is the curent z coordinate - linkLength*linkDirection. This can
%also help with directly calculating the layout of the robot, which will
%help find o_i and _i prime
